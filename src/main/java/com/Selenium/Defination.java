	/*How to handle broken link
	 * ANS.. i am going to collect all the link /each link which is in a a tag then send http request in  each link
	 * then I will verify the http response code .If 200 response code is ok is ok if 400 bad link not it is not ok.
	 * QQ..Is it time westing.
	 * ANS..yes
	 * As it is collection I use stream api
	 * lambada expression java 8
	 * 
	 * Example::
	 * like Amazone has 100 links 
	 * pick one link and doing http request and running loop
	 * we are doing one by one so keep going 100 times just for cheeking http request
	 * wasting  time
	 * We can run it parallaly to save time using parallel stream that is after jdk 1.8
	 * java lambada expression came(any Java collection we can use)
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * QQ...Do you head about the pagination in java
	 * Ans.. To devide a large number of records into amultiple parts
	 * we use pagination.It allows to user display a part of records only.Loading all records on a single page may take time.
	 * in that case we recomended to created pagenation.Pojo class
